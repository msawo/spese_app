# Spese App

### Spese means expense in Italian.

## My Goal

In this project, I want to build an expense app that helps the user keep track of their expenses such as groceries, accessories etc on specific dates on the calendar. It will also show a chart of which expense(s) take the most money out of their budget. 


## What I'll create

I've created so far.....
